# Review of React Hooks and Redux

## ðŸ’¡ What did I learn:

- How to use Callback functions to memoize functions so they aren't created after each render - unless their depend on it, in this case use the dependency array and think on what are you depending here.

- How to use UseMemo to Memoize a value, and ensure that the operation only re-executes if something changes on the dependencies.

- How to setup a store, reducers, combine reducers, and rootReducer using redux toolkit.

- How to Create a slice, and all the actions associated to that Slice.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps:

- Solidify the basics;
- Continue learning and practicing redux and more advanced concepts of react;
